# VLM OpenVINO serving microservice

The VLM OpenVINO serving is a microservice that provides a FastAPI based OpenVINO runtime serving supporting VLM models not supported yet in OpenVINO model serving. It is intended to perform inference over multi-modal VLM models by taking image and video as inputs.

## Overview

The microservice is a simple model serving to be able to do inference using VLM models on a GPU or CPU hardware. It provides OpenAI standard chat completions API along with ability to deploy as a docker image or using Helm chart.
