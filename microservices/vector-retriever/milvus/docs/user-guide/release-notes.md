# Release Notes: Vector Retriever - Milvus

## Version 2026.1.0

**June 17, 2026**:

**Fixed**

- Docker base images for both the visual data preparation for retrieval and vector retriever Milvus services updated from the pinned `python:3.12.12-slim` to the rolling `python:3.12-slim`; the build now runs a full apt-get upgrade to apply all available OS-level security patches, and apt-get clean is performed to reduce image size.

- `astapi` upgraded from `0.121.1` to `0.121.3` and `pydantic` from `2.9.1` to `2.10.6` to resolve dependency scan findings.

  - Retriever Service: Retrieves data from Milvus based on text queries.
